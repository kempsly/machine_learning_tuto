## Contents

### **1. Clustering Algorithms**
This folder contains subfolders for specific clustering methods, each with its own notebook:
- **K-Means Clustering**: Implements and visualizes K-Means clustering with techniques for selecting optimal cluster numbers.
- **Hierarchical Clustering**: Discusses dendrogram-based clustering methods with Agglomerative and Divisive approaches.
- **DBSCAN (Density-Based Clustering)**: Explores DBSCAN for identifying non-linear clusters in noisy datasets.
- **Graph-Based Clustering**: Explains clustering using graph theory and demonstrates Spectral Clustering.

### **2. PCA Algorithms**
Focuses on **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** for dimensionality reduction and pattern extraction.

### **3. Dimensionality Reduction**
Contains notebooks on reducing high-dimensional data using various algorithms:
- **PCA for Dimension Reduction**: Highlights PCA's role in feature reduction.
- **t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding)**: Visualizes high-dimensional data in 2D or 3D space.
